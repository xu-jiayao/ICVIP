<--- ## Correction: 

After conducting a comprehensive review of our published work, we have identified a typographical error in our reference to the measurement matrix. In the paper, we mistakenly labeled the matrix as the 'Hadamard matrix'; however, the correct term is the 'Walsh matrix,' as stated in Section 4, first paragraph.

Thank you for your reading and understanding.
