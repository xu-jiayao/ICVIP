The code to published paper "High-speed Compressed Sensing Reconstruction using Zigzag Ordering based Parallel Processing", International Conference on Image and Video Processing (ICIVP 2020), Oct. 2020.

Correction: 
Upon a thorough review of our published work, we have recognized that a typo exists in our reference to the measurement matrix. In the paper, we inadvertently referred to the matrix as the "Hadamard matrix" when, in fact, the accurate term is the "Walsh matrix", at Section.4, first paragraph.
